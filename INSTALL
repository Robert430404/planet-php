PREQUISITES
***********

- PHP 5 (with enabled xslt support -> --with-xsl)
- The tidy extension (optional, if you don't want to tidy it, just comment it out in the sitemap)
- A database (only tested with mysql, but should work with others, too)
- MDB2 ( pear install MDB2)
- Cache (pear install Cache), if you want caching

  svn co http://svn.bitflux.org/repos/public/planet-php/trunk planet-php

  (or use a webdav client an copy it from the above http location)

- cp inc/config.inc.php-dist to inc/config.inc.php

- adjust the dsn parameter (and other config options if you want)

- make a "tmp" directory and make it writeable for the webserver

- import the db from div/db/mysql.sql

- import the feeds with the libs/scripts/aggregate.php script
